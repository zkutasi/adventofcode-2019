# adventofcode-2019

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2019 Challenges (https://adventofcode.com/).

* All of them is written with Python 2.7
* None of the solutions require special packages, only the core Python environment
* All of them are unique solutions that was not done with any peeking on existing ones, there are few exceptions though when I hopelessly got stuck and I went to the Reddit page of solutions to see how people approached the problem
* Many of them take parameters (like the input file to read, or how many cycles to execute, etc...)
* Some of them provide visual representation of the problem (maybe there is code inside but switched off)
* Some of them may be not optimal, but they finish on time, some of them are really quick though


# Challenges

## DAY 1
* Part1 is trivial
* Part2, pay attention to the suggestion: calculate the extra mass for each module separately, not for the whole all at once, different results may come

## DAY 2
* Part1, read the instructions :)
* Part2, I rewrote to have some OOP, lets see if it is usable or not, not using any pretty exceptions or non-globals, not needed to be pretty
